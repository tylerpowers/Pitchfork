# Pitchfork AI Project
This is a simple AI project that uses a fine-tuned version of the pre-trained GPT-2 model to generate a fake review
made by the music reviewing website Pitchfork.com. In this repo you can find the files necessary to train and run the
model, but not the model itself nor the SQLite file I took the reviews from. That can be accessed here:

(especially if you're on a MacBook like me). Have fun generating more snobby, pretentious reviews for fake artists and 
albums!
